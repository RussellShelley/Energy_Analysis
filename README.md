# Energy_Analysis
Questions we need to answer for First Segment: 
* Selected topic
* Reason we selected the topic
    * Electric vehicles currently make up only about 2% of all cars sold in the US. Many drivers have put off purchasing electric vehicles until now for many reasons such as expense and concerns over the availability of plug-in recharge points. However, current trends show that these statistics are likely to change. The purpose of this project is to explore an overall analysis of the electric vehicle car market, availability of charging stations, and potential climate implications. We choose this project because of it's immediate relevance as well as potential large scale global and humanitarian impact.
